                <p>My first ever project was creating a <em>HTML document</em> introducing myself, my family, my friends, my subject profile and student
                    panel. I created this project during my 3rd year High School and one of the most memorable experience I had in related to HTML 
                    and CSS.</p>

                <p><em> To do List</em> is a project given by our Professor in our Application Development subject. We used React Native to create the Application
                    and code it in Snack expo. The To do List app basically create, delete, and check tasks which can be used for organizing tasks and 
                    creating order for your daily routine.</p>

                <p>This project is a <em>Sample Payroll Sytem.</em> The project is created in Visual Studio which was tasked by our Professor in our Programming 
                    Language subject. It was a thrilling and exciting experience to design and program a software which can be shared and use for many 
                    purposes. The only problem I encountered is that I am not too familiar with the language used.</p>

                <p>I am currently a Data Scientist Scholar for <em>SPARTA Scholarship Courses.</em> In this course, there are free online lessons with certain activities, tasks,
                    and exams included for specific courses. I've been learning how to use excel, python, data analysis, business analytics, etc. One of the programs I did
                    was some basic programs such as conversion of height, currency, temperature, etc. in python.
